SoConnect is a **desktop app for SoC students to manage contacts of Professors and Teaching Assistants,
as well as to keep track of noteworthy events, optimized for use via a _Command Line Interface (CLI)_** while still having
the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_.

This developer guide is targeted at current and potential developers and testers of the SoConnect project. The purpose of this guide is to outline the architecture and some implementation details of SoConnect, so that developers and testers are aware of how to navigate this project.

## **Acknowledgements**

* The Calendar UI is inspired by another team project - [AY2122S1 CS2103T-F13-3](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-3.github.io/tp/). However, the implementation of the calendar UI is largely our own, other than a few instances of code reuse from the [CalendarFX Quick Start](https://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html#_quick_start) page.

This section will cover the design considerations and implementations of the various components of SoConnect, and how each component is related to other components.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the SoConnect App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the SoConnect app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `edelete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `UI` component:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several `UiPart` components, such as `ContactListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `CalendarWindow` and the different components within `Other UI components`. The `Other UI components` contain the following classes: `HelpWindow`, `CommandBox`, `StatusBarFooter` and `ResultDisplay`. These classes are not drawn in the diagram for brevity.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. Only the `CalendarWindow` component uses the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) dependency. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](hhttps://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* passes the user commands to the `Logic` component to be executed.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edelete 1-3")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edelete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CAddCommandParser`, `EDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![SoConnect Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the SoConnect data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object) and all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` and `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `ContactDisplaySetting` and an `EventDisplaySetting` object (not shown in the diagram). These settings will affect how the contacts and events will be displayed to the user.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Contact` and ` Event` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Contact` or `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="350" />
</div>


### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons)

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package. For example, the `Range` class, specified in [`Range.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/range/Range.java) encapsulates a range of indexes that are used by the `EDeleteCommand` and `CDeleteCommand` classes in logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete Events feature

This section details how an `Event` or multiple `Event` objects are deleted using the `edelete` command.

The `edelete` command allows users to delete a single or an inclusive range of consecutive events from the current event list shown on SoConnect. The user needs to specify either an `Index` or a `Range` of event(s) to be deleted. Such event(s) would be removed from the `EventListPanel` in the GUI.

#### Implementation

We will use an example command: `edelete 1-3`.

The sequence diagram below shows how the execution of the example command flows:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edelete 1 - 3` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Given below is one example usage scenario and explains how the `edelete` feature behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `edelete 1-3` to delete the events at indexes 1, 2 and 3.

Step 2: The user input argument is passed to the `EDeleteCommandParser` object, which parses the input arguments and creates a `Range` object for the range .

Step 3: This `Range` object is used to construct a new `EDeleteCommand` object. `EDeleteCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager` to be executed.

Step 4: During the execution, the `EDeleteCommand` object repeatedly deletes each event from the most updated event list through the `Model#deleteEvent` method. At the same time, a new list of `EventChanger` objects containing all the events to be deleted will be created. The [Calendar UI implementation](#calendar-ui-feature) will discuss the use of this list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** If the user only specifies one `Index` for `edelete`, a `Range` object is created with the same start and end `Index`.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Type of user inputs:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Either a single Index or a Range can be specified.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Unable to delete multiple ranges of events or events that are not ordered consecutively in the event list.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow a mixture of multiple single indexes and multiple ranges
    * Pros: Able to delete events more efficiently.
    * Cons: We must ensure that the order of delete of the events is correct. It is more complex to keep track of the events to be deleted.

### List Events feature

This section details how the `elist` command is implemented. This command allows the user to view all events, with the added feature of allowing the user to specify which _field_ to display. By default, all fields will be displayed.

#### Implementation

As outlined in the [Logic component section](#logic-component), both `EListCommandParser` and `EListCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `elist` command.

The `parse` method inside the `EListCommandParser` receives the user input, extracts the required prefix(es). It then creates a new immutable `EventDisplaySetting` object that will encapsulate the visibility of the various fields for all events in the _GUI_.

* If no prefix is provided, the `parse` method will set all fields of the `Event` class to be displayed. This is the default setting.
* If one or more prefix(es) is / are provided, `parse` will set the corresponding field(s) to be displayed,
  sets the rest of the fields to be hidden.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** If values of prefixes given are not empty, `EListCommandParser#parse` throws a ParseException.
</div>

`EListCommandParser#parse` method will then return an `EListCommand` with the given `EventDisplaySetting` object.

Given below is one example usage scenario and explains how the `elist` feature behaves at each step. You may also refer to the sequence diagram below.

Step 1. The user enters `elist at/ end/` to display only the start and end timings of events. The arguments `at/ end/` are passed to the `EListCommandParser` through the `parse` method call.

Step 2. The user input `at/ end/` will be subjected to checks by methods from [`ArgumentMultimap`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ArgumentMultimap.java) to ensure that there are no incorrect arguments in the command. Examples of incorrect arguments include `1` or `at/3`.

Step 3. A `EventDisplaySetting` object is created based on the input arguments.
   * If there are no inputs, then the default `EventDisplaySetting.DEFAULT_SETTING` object is created.
   * Since there are inputs for this example, an `EventDisplaySetting` with the `willDisplay` fields for `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` will be set to true. All other fields will be set to false (hidden). `isViewingFull` will be set to false, since this is not a `view` command.

Step 4. A new `EListCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 5. During the execution of the command, the `EListCommand` object will set update the `EventDisplaySetting` of the `Model` to the object created in step 3. Thereafter, the event cards are re-rendered, which will cause the `EventListPanel` in the UI component to update all the `EventCard` elements to display the events based on the new display settings.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` with all events listed is returned and will be displayed to the user.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `elist` feature works for the example:

![EListSequenceDiagram](images/EListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `elist` feature is triggered:

![EListActivityDiagram](images/EListActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to allow hiding of specific fields:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** EListCommand displays all fields.
    * Pros: No need to check for valid prefixes.
    * Cons: User may be interested in one field, but has to look through all the fields.
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** EListCommand allows users to choose which fields to display.
  * Pros: User can choose to hide long details about the event and focus on the details important to them.
  * Cons: There is more room for mistakes, since it is more difficult to parse the user input correctly.

**Aspect: Changing the display settings of events:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** Keep the settings directly in static fields in the `Event` class.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and it is possible to change the settings even in the parser.
  * Cons: It is difficult to test static variables since other tests may interfere with the state of the variables. Moreover, it will be impossible to implement a feature such as undo if the static fields are changed. This is unlike having a separate object like `EventDisplaySetting`, which is immutable and can be stored in history. In general, [manipulating global static variables is a bad idea](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7026507/why-are-static-variables-considered-evil).

* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** Encapsulate the settings in a `EventDisplaySetting` class and update it in the `ModelManager`.
  * Pros: The settings are immutable so the implementation is less prone to errors.
  * Cons: More code will have to be written in order to facilitate the change in display settings.

### Link Event feature

This section details how the `elink` command is implemented. This command allows the user to link a single event to any number of contacts. This link is bi-directional and will be displayed to the user.

#### Implementation

The following operations are the main operations for `elink`.

- `ELinkCommandParser#parse` - Parse the user inputs and create a `ELinkCommand` to return.

- `ELinkCommand#execute` - Links the event to the target contact.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `elink` operation works:

![ELinkSequenceDiagram](images/ELinkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `edelete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the event list. The `edelete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `edelete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `cadd n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `cadd` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `clist`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `clist`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `eclear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `cdelete`, just save the contact being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Calendar UI feature

The calendar UI is implemented using the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) framework. It can be opened using either the shortcut key `F2`, the file dropdown menu, or the command `calendar`. This feature is mainly facilitated by the `CalendarWindow` class. The `CalendarCommand` class handles the `calendar` command that the user may type and the `MainWindow` class handles the shortcut key and the dropdown menu option for showing the calendar.

#### Design of CalendarWindow

The `CalendarWindow` class extends from `UiPart`, just like the other UI components including the help window. The `CalendarWindow` class instance contains a table of events and the respective entries in the `Calendar` object. There are also final instances of `Calendar` and `CalendarView` objects in a `CalendarWindow` object. See the [CalendarFX manual](https://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html) for more information on `Calendar` and `CalendarView` classes.

![Sequence diagram of CalendarWindow](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence of how a calendar window is generated is shown in the UML sequence diagram above. The following are the textual descriptions of the diagram:

1. The user intends to open the calendar. The `MainWindow` object captures this intention and calls the constructor of `CalendarWindow` and passes the list of events into it.
2. The `Calendar` and `CalendarView` objects are created and stored. A _hashmap_ of `Event` objects to `Entry` objects is created. (Not shown)
3. A time thread is created to constantly update the current time of the calendar every 10 seconds.
4. The `Calendar` object is populated with the entries of events from Step 1. The _hashmap_ is also concurrently being updated with the events and the associated entries. (Not shown)
5. The `CalendarView` object is updated to include the `Calendar` object, and also to change some configurations to simplify the interface and prevent edits directly on the calendar.
6. The `StackPane` (see [`CalendarWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/CalendarWindow.fxml)) is updated to include the new `CalendarView` interface. The `CalendarWindow` object is now created and returned to `MainWindow`.

#### Design considerations

The user may leave the calendar window open and type in a new command to add, delete, edit or clear the events. In that case, there is a need to constantly update the calendar to reflect the new changes the user has made. This section discusses the implementation of the update and how the updates are optimized.

**Aspect: How the calendar is updated constantly:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only updates the event(s) changed by the event commands.
    * Pros: More optimized and faster update for large number of events.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and prone to errors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** It is important to discuss the `EventChanger` class from `Model` since the implementation of the update feature depends heavily on this class.
</div>

The `EventChanger` class contains references to up to 2 `Event` objects - an `oldEvent` and a `newEvent`. It also contains a boolean that is true if the user intends to clear all events. Creating the `EventChanger` object to be passed to the `CalendarWindow` to update the entries is simple, as it can be easily constructed using one of the _factory methods_: `addEventChanger`, `clearEventChanger`, `deleteEventChanger` and `editEventChanger`. See the class diagram below for a summary of the `EventChanger` class.

![Class Diagram of EventChanger](images/EventChangerClassDiagram.png)

Upon the execution of any command, the list of event changers is returned in the `CommandResult`. The list is usually empty, except for the 4 types of commands listed above. The `updateCalendar` method of `CalendarWindow` is then called, which will update the `Calendar` object to remove the `oldEvent` and add the `newEvent` entries. The `Calendar` is cleared if the `EventChanger` is the `clearEventChanger`. This is when the _hashmap_ becomes useful, since the `Entry` objects in the calendar are unique and having the same `Event` associated to the `Entry` does not make the `Entry` objects equal. This will allow deletion of the `Entry` from the calendar.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new Calendar with all the events for each command executed.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less code is needed.
    * Cons: Performance can be slowed down if there are many events, even if the user does not make any large change to the events.

This alternative implementation will cause the `MainWindow` class to constantly query the event list in the `AddressBook` through the `Logic` manager every time a command is executed. The queried list is then used to create a new `Calendar` which will be used by the `CalendarWindow` object to display the calendar to the user. However, the performance cost is not feasible if there are many events stored in the `AddressBook`.

*{More to be added}*

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.


* [**Main Success Scenario**](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#requirements-specifying-requirements-use-cases-details) (MSS): Describes the most straightforward interaction for a given use case, which assumes that nothing goes wrong. 


* **Command Line Interface** (CLI): Text-based user interface.


* **Graphical User Interface** (GUI): Graphic-based user interface.


* **Interface**: The place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act on or communicate with each other/ a way for the user to interact with the system.


* **Telegram handle**: Username of a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) user.


* **Professor** (Prof): A lecturer who teaches a module in NUS.


* **Teaching Assistant** (TA): A student tutor employed to teach small group lessons in NUS.


* **Contact information**: Name and email of the contact. Phone number, address, telegram handle, video conferencing meeting link, and tag(s) are optional.


* **Field**: A particular detail of an event or contact. Examples of fields include the name of a contact, the description of an event or the tags of an event.


* **Hashmap**: A data structure that stores a table of keys and their corresponding values. In the implementation of Calendar UI, a hashmap is used to store the `Event` objects as keys and the `Entry` object as values.


* **Factory method**: A method to create an object without specifying the exact class, based on the creational design pattern. In the context of `EventChanger`, the factory methods create instances of subclasses of `EventChanger`, as seen in [`EventChanger.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/event/EventChanger.java).

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting an event

1. Deleting an event while all events are being shown

   Prerequisites: List all events using the `elist` command. Multiple events in the list.

   2. Test case: `edelete 1`<br>
      Expected: First event is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted event shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `edelete 0`<br>
      Expected: No event is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `edelete`, `edelete x` (where x is larger than the list size), `edelete a` <br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

   5. Test case: `edelete 1-2`<br>
      Expected: First and second event are deleted from the list. Details of the deleted events shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   6. Test case: `edelete 2-1` (invalid range)<br>
      Expected: No event is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
   
   7. Test case: `edelete 1-x` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   Prerequisite: There should be a valid `soconnect.json` file saved in the data folder.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** If there is no json file, start `soconnect.jar`, perform some changes to the default list of contacts or events (see [User Guide](../UserGuide.html)). A folder `data` with a file `soconnect.json` should be created.
</div>

   1. Test case: Edit the json file in order to corrupt it. For example, add an additional `{` to create some syntax error. Then, start `soconnect.jar`. <br>
   Expected: The event and contact list is empty.

   2. Test case: Delete the json file and start `soconnect.jar`. <br>
   Expected: The default event and contact list is loaded (see [User Guide](../UserGuide.html#quick-start) for an example).
      

### Listing all events

1. Listing all event with certain fields shown.

    Prerequisites: At least one event in the list.

    1. Test case: `elist at/`<br>
       Expected: All events listed with only address displayed. All events listed shown in the status message.  
    1. Test case: `elist`<br>
       Expected: All events listed with all fields displayed. All events listed shown in the status message.

    1. Other incorrect `elist` commands to try: `elist 123`, `elist at/0000`, `elist xyz/` (where xyz is not a valid prefix)<br>
       Expected: No change in display. Error message shown in status bar.
