### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the SoConnect App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the SoConnect app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `edelete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. Only the `CalendarWindow` component uses the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) dependency. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](hhttps://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CAddCommandParser`, `EDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)
![SoConnect Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the SoConnect data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object) and all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` and `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Contact` and ` Event` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Contact` or `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="350" />
</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Delete Events feature
This section details how an `Event` or multiple `Event` objects are deleted using the `edelete` command.

The `edelete` command allows users to delete a single or an inclusive range of consecutive events from the current event list shown on SoConnect.
Users needs to specify either an `Index` or a `Range` of event(s) to be deleted.
The deleted event(s) would be removed from the display of SoConnect GUI.

#### Implementation

We will use an example command: `edelete 1-3`.

The sequence diagram below shows how the execution of the example command flows:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edelete 1 - 3` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How `edelete` works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes user's input. `AddressBookParser` is used to realise it is a `edelete` command, creating a new `EDeleteCommandParser` object.

Step 2: `EDeleteCommandParser` object parses the input arguments and creates a `Range` object.

Step 3: `Range` object is used to construct a new `EDeleteCommand` object. `EDeleteCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager`.

Step 4: `LogicManager` calls `execute` method of `EDeleteCommand`, which repeatedly deletes event from the most updated event list with index `1` for `3` times.

The event list will be updated to a new list after each delete. Deleting an inclusive range of events is done by repeatedly deleting the event from the start `Index` for `endIndex - startIndex + 1` times.

If the user only specified one `Index` for `edelete`, a `Range` object is created with the same start and end `Index`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Type of user inputs:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Either a single Index or a Range can be specified.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Unable to delete multiple ranges of events or events that are not ordered consecutively in the event list.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow a mixture of multiple single indexes and multiple ranges
    * Pros: Able to delete events more efficiently.
    * Cons: We must ensure that the order of delete of the events is correct. It is more complex to keep track of the events to be deleted.

### List Events feature

The EList feature is facilitated by `EListCommand`, `EListCommandParser` and `model`.

#### EList Command

`EList Command` class extends the `Command` abstract class. `EListCommand` class is tasked to list specific field(s) of
all events and creating a new `CommandResult` to be displayed to the user in the user interface.

`EListCommandParser`
`EListCommandParser` class extends `Parser` interface.
`EListCommandParser` class is tasked with parsing the user inputs and generate a new `EListCommand`.
The main logic of the elist feature is encapsulated here.

The `parse` method inside the `EListCommandParser` receives the user input, extracts the required prefix(es) and set which field(s) to be displayed based on the prefix(es) provided.
* If no prefix is provided, the `parse` method will set all fields of the `Event` class to be displayed.
* If one or more prefix(es) is / are provided, `parse` will set the corresponding field(s) to be displayed,
  sets the rest of the fields to be hidden.

`EListCommandParser#parse` method will then return an `EListCommand`

* If values of prefixes given are not empty, `EListCommandParser#parse` throws a ParseException.

-------------------------------------------------------
Given below is one example usage scenario and explains how the elist feature behaves at each step.

Example 1: List start and end times of all events.

Step 1. The user enters `elist at/ end/`.

Step 2. The command word `elist` is extracted out in `AddressBookBookParser`, and matches the `COMMAND_WORD` for `EListCommand` class.

Step 3. The remaining user input is the given to the `EListCommandParser` to determine if the user input contains the valid fields.

Step 4. Inside `EListCommandParser#parse()` method, the remaining user input `at/ end/`, will be subjected to checks by `EListCommandParser#anyPrefixValueNotEmpty()` and `argMultimap#getPreamble()#isEmpty()` methods.
* `EListCommandParser#anyPrefixValueNotEmpty()` returns true if the values of any prefix is not empty, returns false otherwise.
* `argMultimap#getPreamble()#isEmpty()` returns true if there is any input between the command word and the first prefix, returns false otherwise.


Step 5. The `EListCommandParser#parse()` method then proceeds to set `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` fields to be displayed as their prefix(es) `at/` and `end/` are provided. The other fields are set to be hidden.
`EListCommandParser` then creates and calls an `EListCommand` object.

Step 6. The `EListCommand#execute()` first checks if the `model` provided is not null.

Step 7. The `EListCommand#execute()` is then called by the `LogicManager`. In this method, it first hides all the
`Events` before showing each `Events` with only the event `name`, `start` and `end` timings displayed.

Step 8. A `CommandResult` with all events listed will be displayed to the user.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `elist` feature works for Example 1:

![EListSequenceDiagram](images/EListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `elist` feature is triggered:

![EListActivityDiagram](images/EListActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Consideration

#### Aspect: Allowing inputs for EListCommand.

* **Alternative (current implementation): EListCommand displays all fields.**
    * Pros: No need to check for valid prefixes.
    * Cons: User maybe interested in one field, but has to look through all the fields.

### Link Event feature

#### Implementation

The elink mechanism is facilitated by `ELinkCommandParser` which implements `Parser`, as well as `ELinkCommand`
which extends `Command`. `ELinkCommandParser` is responsible for parsing user inputs and ensuring that
the inputs are valid. `ELinkCommand` is responsible for the execution of elink  mechanism to link the event to the 
target contact.

The following operations are the main operations for elink mechanism.

- `ELinkCommandParser#parse` - Parse the user inputs and create a `ELinkCommand` to return.

- `ELinkCommand#execute` - Links the event to the target contact.

The following sequence diagram shows how the elink operation works:

![ELinkSequenceDiagram](images/ELinkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo/redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `edelete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the event list. The `edelete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `edelete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `cadd n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `cadd` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `clist`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `clist`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `eclear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `cdelete`, just save the contact being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Calendar UI feature

The calendar UI is implemented using the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) framework. It can be opened using either the shortcut key `F2`, the file dropdown menu, or the command `calendar`. This feature is mainly facilitated by the `CalendarWindow` class. The `CalendarCommand` class handles the `calendar` command that the user may type and the `MainWindow` class handles the shortcut key and the dropdown menu option for showing the calendar.

#### Design of CalendarWindow

The `CalendarWindow` class extends from `UiPart`, just like the other UI components including the help window. The `CalendarWindow` class instance contains a table of events and the respective entries in the `Calendar` object. There are also final instances of `Calendar` and `CalendarView` objects in a `CalendarWindow` object. See the [CalendarFX manual](https://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html) for more information on `Calendar` and `CalendarView` classes.

![Sequence diagram of CalendarWindow](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence of how a calendar window is generated is shown in the UML sequence diagram above. The following are the textual descriptions of the diagram:

1. The user intends to open the calendar. The `MainWindow` object captures this intention and calls the constructor of `CalendarWindow` and passes the list of events into it.
2. The `Calendar` and `CalendarView` objects are created and stored. A hashmap of `Event` objects to `Entry` objects is created. (Not shown)
3. A time thread is created to constantly update the current time of the calendar every 10 seconds.
4. The `Calendar` object is populated with the entries of events from Step 1. The hashmap is also concurrently being updated with the events and the associated entries. (Not shown)
5. The `CalendarView` object is updated to include the `Calendar` object, and also to change some configurations to simplify the interface and prevent edits directly on the calendar.
6. The `StackPane` (see `CalendarWindow.fxml`) is updated to include the new `CalendarView` interface. The `CalendarWindow` object is now created and returned to `MainWindow`.

#### Updating the calendar

The user may leave the calendar window open and type in a new command to add, delete, edit or clear the events. In that case, there is a need to constantly update the calendar to reflect the new changes the user has made. This section discusses the implementation of the update and how the updates are optimized.

**Aspect: How the calendar is updated constantly:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only updates the event(s) changed by the event commands.
    * Pros: More optimized and faster update for large number of events.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and prone to errors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** It is important to discuss the `EventChanger` class from `Model` since the implementation of the update feature depends heavily on this class.
</div>

The `EventChanger` class contains references to up to 2 `Event` objects - an `oldEvent` and a `newEvent`. It also contains a boolean that is true if the user intends to clear all events. Creating the `EventChanger` object to be passed to the `CalendarWindow` to update the entries is simple, as it can be easily constructed using one of the factory methods: `addEventChanger`, `clearEventChanger`, `deleteEventChanger` and `editEventChanger`. See the class diagram below for a summary of the `EventChanger` class.

![Class Diagram of EventChanger](images/EventChangerClassDiagram.png)

Upon the execution of any command, the list of event changers is returned in the `CommandResult`. The list is usually empty, except for the 4 types of commands listed above. The `updateCalendar` method of `CalendarWindow` is then called, which will update the `Calendar` object to remove the `oldEvent` and add the `newEvent` entries. The `Calendar` is cleared if the `EventChanger` is the `clearEventChanger`. This is when the hashmap becomes useful, since the `Entry` objects in the calendar are unique and having the same `Event` associated to the `Entry` does not make the `Entry` objects equal. This will allow deletion of the `Entry` from the calendar.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new Calendar with all the events for each command executed.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less code is needed.
    * Cons: Performance can be slowed down if there are many events, even if the user does not make any large change to the events.

This alternative implementation will cause the `MainWindow` class to constantly query the event list in the `AddressBook` through the `Logic` manager every time a command is executed. The queried list is then used to create a new `Calendar` which will be used by the `CalendarWindow` object to display the calendar to the user. However, the performance cost is not feasible if there are many events stored in the `AddressBook`.
